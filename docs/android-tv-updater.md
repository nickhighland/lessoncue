# Android TV self-update system

LessonCue's Android TV build is distributed directly from public GitHub Releases. It does not use the Google Play In-App Updates API and cannot silently update an ordinary consumer Android TV or Google TV device. LessonCue downloads and independently verifies the APK, then hands it to Android's official `PackageInstaller`; Android always owns the final user-confirmation screen.

## Architecture

The updater follows the existing application conventions:

- Kotlin and Compose for TV on API 26–36.
- `HttpURLConnection` for HTTPS requests, with explicit timeouts and redirect validation.
- DataStore for the last successful automatic check record and optional-update dismissal.
- An app-private `cacheDir/updates` directory for temporary and verified APK files.
- `PackageManager` for archive metadata and signing-certificate inspection.
- `PackageInstaller` full-install sessions for the system installation flow.
- Lifecycle-bound coroutines for checks and downloads.

No repository credentials, GitHub tokens, signing keys, or private server credentials are stored in the APK.

## Build configuration

The following generated `BuildConfig` values isolate distribution policy from updater code:

| Value | Production setting |
| --- | --- |
| `UPDATE_ENABLED` | `true` for signed release builds and `false` for debug builds |
| `UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` | `https://github.com/nickhighland/lessoncue/releases/latest/download/update.json` |
| `UPDATE_CHANNEL` | `stable` |
| `UPDATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `github.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, and `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` |
| `UPDATE_SIGNING_CERT_SHA256` | LessonCue's permanent production certificate fingerprint |

LessonCue currently has one sideload distribution. It includes `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`, external update checks, and the installer flow. A future Play build must override or omit the manifest URL, remove `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`, hide the external updater interface, and direct users only through Google Play. The updater code is isolated so adding that flavor does not require changing playback, discovery, pairing, or caching.

Debug builds keep the updater interface disabled because Android cannot install the production-signed APK over a debug-signed application. To move a test device from debug to production, uninstall the debug build, install the production APK, and pair the device again. Production-to-production updates install in place and retain application data.

## Manifest schema

Every tagged release publishes an `update.json` asset:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "channel": "stable",
  "versionCode": 30,
  "versionName": "0.26.0",
  "apkUrl": "https://github.com/nickhighland/lessoncue/releases/download/v0.26.0/lessoncue-tv.apk",
  "sha256": "lowercase 64-character SHA-256",
  "fileSize": 11000000,
  "mandatory": false,
  "minimumSupportedVersionCode": 1,
  "releaseNotes": "Release summary"
}
```

The client rejects unsupported schemas, missing or incorrectly typed fields, nonpositive or fractional version codes, another channel, non-HTTPS URLs, user information in URLs, untrusted hosts, malformed or uppercase hashes, invalid sizes, and responses larger than 1 MiB. Update availability is determined only by `versionCode`.

## Check behavior

- LessonCue waits briefly after normal startup and checks once on every app launch.
- Automatic failures are silent and never interrupt playback or pairing.
- **Check for updates** on the lesson library always contacts the release endpoint and reports current, available, or unable to check.
- Choosing **Later** records that optional `versionCode`. Automatic checks do not show it again, while a manual check always does.
- A release blocks normal use only when `mandatory` is true and the installed version is below `minimumSupportedVersionCode`. Required screens retain download, error, permission, and retry paths.

## Download and verification

Downloads use connection and read timeouts, reject untrusted redirects, and stream into `cacheDir/updates/*.part`. LessonCue:

1. prevents concurrent update downloads;
2. removes obsolete update APKs;
3. enforces a 500 MiB absolute maximum;
4. checks the received byte count when `fileSize` is present;
5. checks the manifest SHA-256;
6. atomically renames only a verified file;
7. removes partial or invalid files after cancellation, network loss, HTTP failure, storage errors, or process interruption;
8. asks Android to parse the APK;
9. verifies `org.lessoncue.tv`;
10. requires a greater APK `versionCode` that exactly matches the manifest;
11. compares installed and downloaded signing certificates, including available signing history; and
12. requires the permanent LessonCue production certificate in production builds.

The original and every redirected URL must remain HTTPS and on the explicit host allowlist.

## Android installation permission and confirmation

If Android has not granted **Allow from this source**:

1. LessonCue explains why the permission is required.
2. The operator explicitly selects **Open Android settings**.
3. LessonCue opens `ACTION_MANAGE_UNKNOWN_APP_SOURCES` for its own package.
4. The operator enables the setting and returns.
5. LessonCue checks the permission again; it never reopens Settings automatically.

If that settings activity is unavailable, the screen gives the manual path: **Settings → Apps → Special app access → Install unknown apps → LessonCue**.

After verification and permission, LessonCue creates a full-install `PackageInstaller` session, declares the package and expected size, streams the APK, calls `fsync`, and commits through an explicit mutable `PendingIntent`. It handles pending confirmation, success, cancellation, blocked installs, package conflicts, incompatible or invalid APKs, insufficient storage, and generic failure. Only the system-provided confirmation intent is opened.

## Publishing a release

The production application ID and signing identity must never change. Before tagging:

1. Increase Android `versionCode`.
2. Update `versionName` and the other LessonCue package/client versions.
3. Run unit tests, lint, debug build, instrumentation APK compilation, and a production-signed release build.
4. Confirm no keystore, recovery document, password, token, or signing material is tracked by Git.
5. Push the reviewed commit and create a `v*` tag.

The release workflow:

- loads the existing keystore only from GitHub Actions secrets;
- builds debug and production APKs;
- verifies the production signing-certificate fingerprint;
- extracts the actual package version from the signed APK;
- creates `lessoncue-tv.apk.sha256` and `update.json`;
- publishes both Android builds, both server architectures, Windows, and `SHA256SUMS`; and
- fails before publishing if any production signing or metadata check fails.

Required repository secrets remain:

- `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_BASE64`
- `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_SIGNING_CERT_SHA256`

Keep the keystore and both passwords in at least two encrypted, access-controlled locations, including one offline copy. Losing the signing identity prevents installed devices from accepting future in-place updates.

## First updater release and safe testing

Versions before the updater exists cannot discover it. Install the first updater-enabled production APK manually over the existing production-signed application. Do not uninstall first; an in-place install retains pairing, settings, cached media, and the application identity.

For a safe end-to-end test:

1. Keep one nonproduction television on the previous signed release.
2. Publish a higher `versionCode` with `mandatory: false`.
3. Open **Check for updates** using only the D-pad.
4. Verify the version, notes, and size.
5. Choose **Later**, then confirm a manual check still shows the release.
6. Download, deny unknown-app permission, return, and verify the app remains usable.
7. grant permission, return, and select the update again;
8. cancel Android's confirmation once and verify retry;
9. install, relaunch LessonCue, and confirm pairing, settings, assignments, and cached media remain.

## Acceptance matrix

- [ ] Current version reports **LessonCue is current**.
- [ ] Optional update can be postponed.
- [ ] Manual check shows a previously postponed version.
- [ ] Permission denial returns to a usable permission screen without a settings loop.
- [ ] Permission approval resumes the verified installation.
- [ ] Canceling a download removes the partial file and allows retry.
- [ ] Interrupting network access reports an error and allows retry.
- [ ] Process termination during download leaves no accepted partial APK.
- [ ] Wrong SHA-256 is rejected before package parsing.
- [ ] Wrong application ID is rejected.
- [ ] Wrong signing key is rejected.
- [ ] Lower or equal APK version code is rejected.
- [ ] Manifest/APK version disagreement is rejected.
- [ ] System confirmation cancellation reports a retryable failure.
- [ ] Successful update retains pairing, settings, assignments, and cached media.
- [ ] App restarts normally after installation.
- [ ] Every updater action is reachable and understandable with D-pad only.
- [ ] Mandatory update blocks normal use only below `minimumSupportedVersionCode`.
- [ ] Mandatory download, permission, error, and retry paths remain usable.

For v0.26.0, 20 JVM tests passed (including 17 updater policy, parser, hash, size, package, version, and signing tests), and all 7 updater instrumentation tests passed on the Android 16 Google TV 1080p emulator. The instrumentation suite exercises default focus, optional and mandatory controls, manual current/available/error-and-retry results, cancellation, permission return, and persisted installer callbacks. Unit tests, lint, debug APK, and instrumentation-APK compilation also run in CI.

The physical-device rows above must still be exercised on representative Google TV, Android TV, and Fire TV hardware before declaring a model supported.

## Rollback and recovery

Android normally rejects installing a lower `versionCode`. The safe production rollback is a corrective APK with a new, higher version code signed by the same production identity. Uninstalling and installing an older version discards application data and should be reserved for a documented disaster-recovery test. A bad or compromised manifest can be removed from the latest GitHub release to stop new downloads while a corrective release is prepared.

Silent installation is unavailable on ordinary consumer devices by Android design. Device-owner or enterprise-management installation is outside LessonCue's current scope.
