# LessonCue change log

This is the release history for LessonCue. Each release publishes both user and
developer notes on GitHub; the app shows only the user changes before an
administrator installs an update.

## v0.40.5 — clearer updates and a more dependable release

### User changes

- The update screen now explains the purpose of an available update before you install it.
- Media uploads now follow the current two-step media workflow.
- Administration screens have clearer contrast and better labels for keyboard and assistive-technology users.

### Developer changes

- Browser validation now follows the current two-step media workflow and tolerates cross-platform font rasterization.
- Release validation no longer depends on the Bubblewrap gate that cannot run reliably on GitHub-hosted runners.
- GitHub releases publish both sections, while Android TV update metadata carries only the user changes.
