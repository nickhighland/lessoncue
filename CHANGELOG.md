# LessonCue change log

This is the release history for LessonCue. Each release publishes both user and
developer notes on GitHub; the app shows only the user changes before an
administrator installs an update.

## v0.45.10 — Custom Link Studio favicon

### User changes

- Administrators can choose a custom favicon for the Link Studio web client
  from **Access & brand**.

### Developer changes

- The companion validates and persists favicon data alongside the existing
  branding settings, applies it to the browser tab, and keeps the default
  favicon as the fallback.

## v0.45.9 — Complete Link Studio analytics charts

### User changes

- Platform and device analytics now show a complete ring when all recent
  visits belong to one category.

### Developer changes

- Full-circle SVG segments avoid browser-specific dash rendering gaps while
  mixed breakdowns retain their proportional arcs.

## v0.45.8 — Reliable Link Studio rebuilding

### User changes

- Link Studio now rebuilds correctly when the server performs a protected
  LessonCue update.

### Developer changes

- Shortener installers use a writable Docker client configuration directory
  instead of the unavailable root home directory under systemd hardening.

## v0.45.7 — Preserve short-domain forwarding

### User changes

- Installing or refreshing the URL shortener now preserves the configured
  destination for the bare short domain.

### Developer changes

- The protected Linux shortener-install path and the standalone installer both
  pass through LessonCue's saved root-redirect handoff instead of allowing an
  empty value to replace it.

## v0.45.6 — Reliable activity editor saves

### User changes

- Applying an activity preset or entering a media URL immediately before saving
  now saves the new value reliably.

### Developer changes

- Removed stale effect-based draft-ref synchronization that could replace a
  just-entered editor value with the previous draft during a fast save.

## v0.45.5 — LessonCue Shortener installation

### User changes

- The next shortener installation starts the LessonCue Link Shortener
  Companion directly in place of the retired Shlink Web client.
- Short Link game addresses now refresh shortener health before they are
  offered, so a newly installed shortener is available immediately when it is
  healthy.
- Settings is organized behind an expandable left navigation with an overview
  and grouped pages for organization, content and devices, infrastructure, and
  administration.

### Developer changes

- The release bundle includes a one-time `remove-shlink-web-client.sh` utility
  for retiring the old management containers and image without touching Shlink
  or PostgreSQL data.
- The normal installer and updater no longer contain legacy migration cleanup;
  they install the Companion directly as the supported management UI.

## v0.45.4 — Complete Google Play TV release

### User changes

- Google Play production publishing now leaves the release in the Play Console
  for the required review workflow instead of failing during automatic
  submission.

### Developer changes

- Bumped the application and Android TV package versions for the corrected
  production release.

## v0.45.3 — Complete Link Studio migration

### User changes

- Installing or updating the URL shortener now removes the legacy Shlink Web
  container and starts Link Studio under its own service and container name.
- The installer always uses the release's compose file, so a stale compose
  override cannot silently restore the old web client.

### Developer changes

- The Companion migration covers both the old nginx gate and the known Shlink
  Web container naming layouts without touching Shlink or PostgreSQL data.

## v0.45.2 — Link Shortener Companion

### User changes

- The shortener management workspace now uses LessonCue's Link Shortener
  Companion, with separate Administrator and Link Studio accounts.
- Set the initial shared password in LessonCue Settings, then change either
  account independently in the Companion's Access & brand page.

### Developer changes

- The Companion source is bundled and built locally; its scoped Shlink API key
  stays server-side in a Docker secret.
- Install and update paths remove the obsolete v0.45.1 nginx gate before
  publishing the Companion management port, and wait for both services.

## v0.45.1 — Short links that stay set up

### User changes

- The URL shortener no longer reports its own hundred reserved game codes as
  belonging to somebody else. They were LessonCue's all along; it was looking
  them up in the wrong case and never finding them.
- The shortener's web console now asks for a password, which you set in
  Settings. It arrives locked, so publishing its address does not hand it to
  whoever finds it.
- The short domain is now one of the choices for the game join address, rather
  than something that quietly took over once the shortener was running. Games
  whose code the shortener does not hold still get an ordinary address, so a
  wall never carries a dead link.
- Pressing Install for the URL shortener no longer claims the install will
  happen at the next update. It starts immediately, and now says so.
- The shortener panel keeps up with an install while it runs, so the result —
  whether it worked or why it did not — appears without reloading the page.
- Installing the shortener works on a real server: it finds its own files,
  starts only its own containers, and the parts that need to read each other's
  credentials can.
- Queueing an adaptive video profile no longer fails when the same profile is
  being queued elsewhere at that moment.
- Saving an activity right after choosing a preset stores the preset you chose.
  It could still store the previous one.

### Developer changes

- The join address service offers the short domain as a mode and owns the
  decision, so the session no longer overrides whatever the room was set to. It
  takes an interface rather than the shortener itself, which is what lets the
  awkward case -- short domain chosen, code not reserved -- be tested.
- Short URL lookup falls back to the lower-cased slug. Loose mode lower-cases a
  custom slug as it stores it while lookup stays exact, so all hundred codes
  were created and then never found again.
- An nginx gate fronts the console; the console itself is no longer published.
  The gate takes the port the console had, so an existing tunnel route is
  unaffected. The password file is read per request, so a change needs no
  restart.
- The shortener scripts locate their compose file rather than assuming a fixed
  depth, record SHORT_DOMAIN in .env, name the services they start, and leave
  both secrets readable by the unprivileged users that consume them.
- Secretless backups exclude the installer's shortener keys, which live one
  directory below the names the exclusion list held.
- The activity editor writes its draft ref in the same handler as the state
  rather than in an effect. The effect ran after commit, so a save pressed
  before React flushed it read the draft from before the change.
- The browser tests' activity helper waits for the editor to finish handling a
  save rather than for the response alone. It was returning while the client
  still had work to do, so the next step interleaved with it -- which is what
  made a whole spec file fail differently on each loaded run.
- The shortener's console image is swappable through SHORTENER_UI_IMAGE, as the
  API image already was, for anyone running their own build of either.
- The compose guard runs the installer against a stub docker in both layouts,
  and the provisioner's stand-in shortener lower-cases slugs the way the real
  one does.

## v0.45.0 — One button sets up short links

### User changes

- Setting up the URL shortener is now one button. Enter the short domain and
  where the bare domain should forward to, press Install, and everything else
  is worked out: the management address, how LessonCue reaches it, the reserved
  game codes, and Docker itself if this server does not have it yet.
- Changing where the bare short domain forwards to now takes effect. The
  shortener reads that when it starts, so the setting was previously stored and
  quietly ignored.
- The install controls stay on screen until the shortener is actually running,
  and report progress and any error. They used to disappear the moment a domain
  was saved — exactly when they were needed.
- The settings panel shows one thing at a time: two fields and a button before
  it is running, the full configuration after.

### Developer changes

- The updater installs Docker and the Compose plugin when they are missing,
  using the distribution package where it carries Compose v2 and Docker's
  signed repository where it does not. It runs as root; refusing for the want
  of a prerequisite it can satisfy was the wrong division of labour.
- `POST /shortener/install` settles the derived configuration — management
  host, upstream, enabled — and records the root destination where the
  installer reads it at container start.
- `ShortenerService.ReapplyAsync` re-runs the install so a changed root
  destination reaches the running containers.
- `install-latest.sh` and the updater both pass `SHORT_DOMAIN_ROOT_REDIRECT`
  through, so the bare domain forwards from the first start.

## v0.44.0 — Setting up short links in one pass

### User changes

- Fixed: the television could stay on the lobby after the host pressed Start.
  It listened for live updates but never checked again, so anything that
  happened while it was still connecting was missed and nothing recovered it
  until the browser was reloaded.
- Installing the URL shortener is now a switch in Settings. Enter the short
  domain, turn it on, and it installs — no command line, and no waiting for an
  update.
- The hundred reserved game codes provision themselves once the shortener
  answers, instead of waiting for someone to find a Repair button.
- The installer takes where the bare short domain should forward to, so
  `chroc.cc` sends people to your website from the first start.
- The management console arrives pointed at your shortener, with only the API
  key to supply — one click from **Show API key** in Settings.
- Settings names the exact Cloudflare Tunnel routes for this server, and
  recommends putting Cloudflare Access in front of the console's hostname.

### Developer changes

- `shortener:install` joins `update:` and `tunnel:enable` on the protected
  request path, so the console can ask the privileged helper to install now and
  read the outcome back. Where no helper exists the marker still stands and the
  next update honours it, and the response says which happened.
- `ShortenerHealthService` reconciles reserved codes when it finds the
  shortener healthy but incomplete.
- `SHORTENER_BIND` and `SHORTENER_UI_BIND` make the published ports an
  operator's choice, defaulting to loopback since the tunnel is the way in.
- The console is given `SHLINK_SERVER_URL` and `SHLINK_SERVER_NAME` but never
  an API key: it is served to any browser reaching its hostname.
  `SHORTENER_UI_API_KEY` opts in, for hostnames behind Cloudflare Access.

## v0.43.0 — The shortener installs with the server

### User changes

- The URL shortener now installs alongside LessonCue. The Linux installer
  offers it, and an update installs or refreshes it on a server that already
  said yes — so it no longer has to be set up by hand.
- Settings shows the exact Cloudflare Tunnel routes for this server: its own
  address, the ports actually published, and a note that neither needs opening
  on the firewall because the tunnel is the way in.
- The API key LessonCue holds can be shown on request, with the address to
  paste it into, for connecting the shortener's own console.
- Fixed: games stopped using short links on a server left running, because the
  check behind them was only refreshed when somebody opened Settings.

### Developer changes

- The release carries `LessonCue-URL-Shortener.tar.gz` — the compose file and
  its scripts — verified against the same signed checksums as the server.
- `install-latest.sh --with-shortener DOMAIN` installs it and records the
  answer in `/var/lib/lessoncue/config/shortener-domain`; the updater acts on
  that marker. The stack lives in `/opt/lessoncue-shortener`, beside the
  application rather than inside it, since `/opt/lessoncue` is replaced on
  every update.
- `ShortenerHealthService` keeps the short-link gate's finding fresh in the
  background rather than depending on somebody loading the settings page.
- Tunnel routes take the server's own host, and the reveal endpoint is audited
  and excluded from the polled status.

## v0.42.1 — Shortener settings that fill themselves in

### User changes

- The URL shortener's reachable address arrives filled in rather than blank.
  Which address is right depends on how LessonCue itself runs, so it is worked
  out for you instead of left as a guess.
- The management address follows the short domain as you type it, and stops
  following once you override it.
- The Cloudflare Tunnel instructions are always shown, not only after a domain
  has been saved — including the warning that a redirect rule on the whole
  hostname would swallow every short link. Once a domain is set, the exact
  hostnames and ports appear as a table to copy.
- Where this server has a local cloudflared configuration, the merged version
  is shown with the new routes added and every existing one untouched.

### Developer changes

- `ShortenerConfiguration.SuggestUpstream` derives the address from whether
  LessonCue is containerised: the shortener's service name and internal port
  inside the compose network, the published loopback port outside it. Saving
  the field blank stores the suggestion rather than nothing.
- `ForManagedTunnel` returns generic guidance when no domain is configured, so
  the section is useful before setup rather than after it.

## v0.42.0 — Optional URL shortener

### User changes

- LessonCue can now run a self-hosted URL shortener on a short domain of your
  own, giving the organization ordinary short links and giving games short,
  readable join codes on the same domain.
- Games joined at `{your-short-domain}/{code}`. Codes are four characters —
  a letter, a digit, a letter, a digit — with `0`, `1`, `I`, `L` and `O` left
  out so a room can read one off a television. A code typed in lower case works.
- The QR on the lobby screen and the address beside it both use the short
  domain when the shortener is on.
- Entirely optional. An installation that never turns it on is unchanged, and
  one whose shortener stops answering keeps running games on its own addresses.
- Settings → Integrations · URL shortener shows what state it is in, how many
  reserved codes the shortener holds, how many games are using one, and the
  exact Cloudflare Tunnel routes to add. It can test each hostname separately
  and repair codes that have drifted.
- The bare short domain can be sent to the organization's website, to
  LessonCue, or left showing the shortener's own page.

### Developer changes

- Four containers behind a `shortener` compose profile: Shlink, PostgreSQL, the
  web client, and nothing at all when the profile is not requested. The
  database is never published, both published ports bind to loopback, and the
  browser client is deployed with no credentials.
- 100 reserved codes ship as a fixed, version-controlled asset with a digest
  test, because they become slugs inside the shortener and a silent edit would
  strand links.
- Reserved links are permanent. Games take and release codes in LessonCue
  alone, so starting or ending one never touches the shortener.
- Provisioning, reconciliation and repair go through the REST API with a
  credential of LessonCue's own. A slug an administrator created by hand is
  reported as a conflict rather than taken over.
- Replaces the 0.41.0 root-redirect proxy, which put LessonCue in front of the
  short domain. The shortener answers its own root, so the tunnel now points
  there directly.
- `scripts/shortener-install.sh` and `scripts/shortener-update.sh` handle
  secrets, ordering, and update safety; `npm run test:shortener` guards the
  compose file's security properties.

## v0.41.0 — Activities that survive a real lesson

### User changes

- One join code per lesson. A lesson with four games used to hand out four
  codes and four rosters; players now scan once and keep their name, character,
  and score across every game in it, with a control to wipe scores and start
  over.
- Games run themselves. The host presses Start and moderates anything a person
  sent; everything else is on a clock — thirty seconds to answer a multiple
  choice, sixty to draw or write, closing early once everyone is in. Standings
  follow every round.
- Answer clocks now appear on the TV and on every phone. Games timed by
  autonomy previously counted down with nothing on screen showing it.
- The console says what it wants at each phase, and says so plainly when a game
  needs a person before it can continue instead of appearing frozen.
- Hosts can remove a player mid-game. Their phone cannot rejoin, and anything of
  theirs still waiting to be reviewed goes with them.
- A full class fits. The lobby wall used to clip names past roughly two dozen
  players, which looked to a student like a failed join; names now shrink as the
  room fills. Standings say how many players are not on screen, and every player
  sees their own place on their phone.
- Sorting, matching, and grouping answers no longer lose the player's work when
  the screen updates.
- The TV opens straight to its library instead of waiting on the network. On a
  slow or unreachable server this was over twenty seconds of nothing; it is now
  about four, marked as a cached schedule.
- A short domain can send its bare root somewhere useful — an organization's
  website, for example — while every short link and game code underneath it
  keeps working.
- Service Admins can hide Activities while testing, and choose which address the
  room is shown for joining.

### Developer changes

- `ActivitySessionGroup` owns the join code, roster, teams, and scores for a
  lesson; runs join a group rather than each minting their own code.
- `ActivityAutoPilot` decides the next transition from phase alone and returns
  nothing for the lobby and for outstanding moderation, so the two places a
  person is required are structural rather than conventional.
- A refused autonomous action parks the run and records why, instead of leaving
  a due timestamp in the past for the background service to retry every second.
- `CommitAsync` serializes state after stamping rather than before; the previous
  order discarded every write that function made, including the countdown the
  console was meant to show.
- The short domain is routed by one pure function, asserted for every root
  configuration to never claim a non-root path. Requests reach the shortener
  with their original Host so per-domain code resolution still works, and Shlink
  ships behind a compose profile.
- Sign-in, controller unlock, and screen pairing are each performed once per
  test worker; all three share a per-IP budget that the suite had begun to
  exhaust.

## v0.40.58 — Google TV production release

### User changes

- Submitted the LessonCue TV-only bundle to the dedicated Google TV production
  track.

### Developer changes

- Routed the Play release workflow to the Android TV `tv:production` track instead of
  the generic mobile internal track, which rejects the required Leanback TV
  feature.

## v0.40.57 — Google Play internal distribution

### User changes

- Published the signed LessonCue TV bundle to Google Play internal testing from
  tagged GitHub releases.

### Developer changes

- Connected the existing production release workflow to the Google Play
  Developer API for the `org.lessoncue.tv` internal track.

## v0.40.56 — Activity game typography

### User changes

- Added Fredoka for activity questions, answers, instructions, controls, and
  player names.
- Added Luckiest Guy for game names, round/status callouts, scores, reveals,
  and the “TIME'S UP!” moment.

### Developer changes

- Bundled the supplied font files locally with their license notices and kept
  the display face scoped to Activity/game surfaces.
- Corrected participant-preview typography so global admin heading styles cannot
  leak into phone questions and prompts.

## v0.40.55 — Classroom remote preset reliability

### User changes

- Fixed preset selection so choosing a template and applying it immediately
  always saves the selected format, including its engine and preset identity.

### Developer changes

- Kept preset selection local until Apply commits the template, and made the
  server trust the config preset when the top-level identity is stale.

## v0.40.53 — Classroom remote preset reliability

### User changes

- Fixed Activity preset templates so the selected template is always the one
  applied, even when it is chosen and applied immediately.

### Developer changes

- Made the shared preset picker read the live select value when applying a
  template and keep it stable across parent re-renders, removing the
  render-timing race exposed by the release browser suite.

### Reliability fix

- Kept the event-selected preset in a dedicated live ref so Apply cannot fall
  back to the previous template while React reconciles the editor.

## v0.40.50 — Classroom remote navigation

### User changes

- Reworked classroom and universal remotes around three clear tabs: Lesson,
  Playlist, and Activity.
- Made Lesson the weekly lesson picker and Playlist the place for individual
  cue selection, setup, notes, and timing details.
- Reduced the transport controls to compact icon buttons, moved locking to a
  small inline lock icon, and removed the remote header and save-as-app panel.

### Developer changes

- Removed the unused Quick tools launcher and kept screen selection in the
  Lesson surface so universal remote control remains available without a top
  bar.
- Added regression coverage for both remote tab semantics, compact controls,
  header removal, and activity-console continuity.

## v0.40.49 — Jackbox-style Activity rooms and host control polish

### User changes

- Added a full-screen classroom lobby with a persistent room code, scannable QR, absolute phone join address, and one-by-one player arrivals.
- Let players choose a fixed emoji and colour identity, switch players on shared phones, and see their own outcome, points, rank, and total after each reveal.
- Added TV response clocks, between-round standings races, first-in and streak callouts, optional automatic response-window advance, and a live host roster with answer counts.
- Made the host remote retain run timing, estimated finish, overrun guidance, playback errors, and save-as-app instructions alongside the compact controls.

### Developer changes

- Added server-resolved join addresses with reachable-mode fallback, per-participant projections, atomic auto-advance locking, server-derived callouts, and shared presentation components.
- Added lobby, join, identity, participant-result, host-console, standings, stage-clock, palette, sound fallback, reduced-motion, and full catalog smoke coverage.
- Added a manifest-driven optional sound-pack lookup with synthesized fallback cues and restored compact-remote diagnostics and run-of-show information.

## v0.40.48 — Activity game audio and visual polish

### User changes

- Gave Activity stages and participant phones distinct, coordinated colour
  identities for each game family and named preset.
- Added tactile phone feedback, gently animated waiting states, stronger
  countdown urgency, and large touch targets while preserving reduced-motion
  accessibility behavior.
- Added shared Activity sound effects with synthesized fallbacks, optional
  licensed sound-pack support, and display-only lobby/round/start/end themes.
  Phones never create a room-wide music chorus.
- Preserved teacher-customized themes instead of replacing them with generated
  game palettes.

### Developer changes

- Added shared palette resolution, contrast-aware accent text, Activity juice,
  audio preloading, preset-to-engine-to-shared sound lookup, and TV-only theme
  playback without changing server authority or participant projections.
- Added browser regression coverage for palettes, touch feedback, timer panic
  state, audio fallback/cascade, display ownership, theme transitions, and
  reduced motion.
- Added the documented optional sound-pack asset tree without bundling
  third-party audio.

## v0.40.47 — Google TV Activity display polish and reliability

### User changes

- Fixed the Google TV Activity display so every game in a lesson continues
  rendering when moving from one cue to the next.
- Made the wheel, scoreboards, countdowns, survey boards, ordering games, and
  other content-heavy Activities fit short TV WebView screens without
  clipping.
- Replaced the oversized native playback controls with a thin, translucent
  fading transport and clear web-controller guidance for Activities.
- Added visible loading, reconnect, and recovery states when a TV display
  cannot reach the Activity server.

### Developer changes

- Added a dedicated `/activity-display` projection route for native TV clients
  and keyed native WebViews to cue identity so destroyed views are never
  reused for later Activities.
- Added constrained-viewport browser coverage and a live 27-cue Google TV
  walk covering every seeded Activity type.

## v0.40.46 — Google TV Activity playback fix

### User changes

- Fixed Activity lesson cues on Google TV so they open the shared LessonCue
  web player instead of incorrectly showing “Media unavailable” or its pairing
  screen.
- Fixed Activity cues to open the requested round immediately, pass the paired
  TV identity securely to the shared player, and avoid the unnecessary first-
  play media prompt over the game.

### Developer changes

- Added TV playback-routing regression coverage for Activity cues that use a
  web-player URL without a downloadable media asset, including paired identity
  and web-player cache-busting coverage.

## v0.40.45 — Animal activity test pack and game-show polish

### User changes

- Added a ready-to-play animal-themed test catalog covering every current
  teacher-facing Activity Studio type, all collected in one lesson.
- Added a player-focused fun plan and richer game-show presentation guidance,
  including join prompts, reveal moments, scoring feedback, and celebration.
- Improved the phone-controller path so lesson activities expose their live
  definition, join code, QR link, and participant state to the host.

### Developer changes

- Added an idempotent `--seed-animal-activity-pack` command and regression
  coverage for the 27 current Studio activity types.
- Added live TV trivia join/reveal verification coverage and documented the
  player-facing engagement plan.

## v0.40.44 — Activities and game-show platform

### User changes

- Added Activities Studio with reusable teacher-created games, direct launch,
  lesson integration, grid/list library views, filtering, manual arranging,
  favorites, archiving, and bulk management.
- Added game-show experiences including Trivia, Read the Room, Punchline,
  Fake Out, Survey Board, Order Up, Match Minds, Doodle & Guess, Beat the
  Clock, Bracket Battle, Four Corners, and shared game-show utilities.
- Added phone participation with QR join codes, moderated responses, teams,
  scoring, host controls, reconnect-safe sessions, and flexible content counts.
- Signage is now always live; the obsolete organization feature checkbox was
  removed.

### Developer changes

- Added shared Activity definitions, live sessions, engine registry, role-safe
  projections, server-authoritative actions, scoring, timers, SignalR updates,
  and migration-safe persistence.
- Added Activity lesson-cue protocol, OpenAPI coverage, server validation,
  browser display/participant/host surfaces, and end-to-end coverage.

## v0.40.43 — installation and network guidance

### User changes

- Improved installation and LAN recovery guidance for administrators.

### Developer changes

- Updated the Docker/Avahi installation example to use the permanent
  `lessoncue.local` hostname.

## v0.40.42 — independent off-site backup destinations

### User changes

- Scheduled backups can now upload independently to Nextcloud, ownCloud, and
  another HTTPS WebDAV folder.
- Each destination has its own app-password/token setting, remote copy count,
  maximum age, upload status, retained-copy count, and actionable failure.
- Remote cleanup touches only LessonCue's encrypted `.lcbak` files; unrelated
  files in a shared WebDAV folder are preserved.
- Documentation now explains the separate Cloudflare Access for Infrastructure
  SSH plan and the credentials still required before it can be provisioned.

### Developer changes

- WebDAV listing is depth-limited, redirect-disabled, HTTPS-only, credential-free
  in URLs, and parsed with DTD/external-resolution protections.
- Legacy single-WebDAV policies migrate to the generic destination without
  losing their protected credential or retention settings.
- Added OpenAPI schemas and server tests for dual-provider upload, pruning,
  migration compatibility, retention, and validation failures.

## v0.40.41 — accurate local installer address

### User changes

- Linux installer completion messages now use the saved `.local` hostname, so
  isolated installations point operators to the address they will actually use.

### Developer changes

- Both the packaged installer and the prerequisite/download wrapper validate
  and reuse the persisted local hostname instead of printing a hard-coded name.

## v0.40.40 — reliable root-shell installer invocation

### User changes

- Linux installs now work from `sudo`, a root shell, or `su -c` even when the
  caller's `PATH` omits administrative `sbin` directories.

### Developer changes

- The packaged installer establishes a standard root execution path before
  checking and invoking `runuser`, `setpriv`, and service tooling.

## v0.40.39 — reliable Debian installer prerequisites

### User changes

- Linux installs now include the Debian package that provides `runuser` when
  the distribution splits it from `util-linux`, preventing a false prerequisite
  failure during media-sandbox validation.

### Developer changes

- The installer reports the exact missing capability and keeps the prior
  service recoverable when a host package layout differs.

## v0.40.38 — clearer live workflows and service diagnostics

### User changes

- Audience sessions now guide operators from poll creation to opening and QR sharing, with copy/download actions, live participant and moderation counts, and closed-session recovery.
- Media uploads run a server preflight that names the detected format, converter readiness, expected output, storage limits, and queue position before any bytes are sent.
- Controller focus mode provides large targets, visible current/next context, keyboard/remote shortcuts, selected-room and connection state, and command receipt feedback.
- Lesson editing separates Present now, Schedule, Save draft, Duplicate, Archive, and Delete, with local autosave recovery and a compact timeline.
- Service Admins can inspect storage, converters, queues, displays, backups, and updates and download a redacted support bundle.
- Large administration workspaces load on demand, with a first-interaction performance mark and a checked JavaScript bundle budget.

### Developer changes

- Added `/api/v1/media/preflight` and `/api/v1/support/bundle` to the OpenAPI contract.
- Expanded media preflight diagnostics across the broad catalog, including optional WebP/Theora and LibreOffice/Poppler readiness.
- Added browser accessibility, end-to-end, protocol, server, real-use, and bundle-budget verification to the release checklist.

## v0.40.37 — streamline signage playlist editing

### User changes

- Playlist cards now keep the timeline compact with a single duration indicator; production notes and item settings stay in the left inspector.
- The Playlist inspector now combines playlist and selected-item editing without a duplicate Selected item tab.
- Video items offer a Full video duration timing option, while custom timing remains available.
- Calendar elements keep one larger editable Title textbox so users can control title line breaks.

### Developer changes

- Removed the card-level notes/settings popovers and their duplicate controls while preserving inspector editing and playlist persistence.
- Full video timing derives from the selected media asset duration and updates the playlist item duration used for signage playback.
- Added browser coverage for full-video timing, consolidated inspector editing, and the compact card controls.
- Release metadata advances to 0.40.37 and Android version code 96.

## v0.40.36 — polished compact weather card

### User changes

- Weather elements now match the reference design with a bold location heading, illustrated condition icon, prominent temperature, and a clean precipitation, high/low, and wind row.
- Compact weather panels keep every text and icon region separate, so the temperature, conditions, and detail values no longer overlap or become partially obscured.
- Weather styling now adds a subtle dimensional background, purpose-built sun, droplet, and wind artwork, and consistent typography in both the editor and the live display.

### Developer changes

- Rebuilt the weather card around bounded responsive title, reading, and metrics rows shared by editor previews and live signage.
- Added browser geometry regression checks for clipping and overlap at narrow signage-panel dimensions.
- Release metadata advances to 0.40.36 and Android version code 95.
